## Current focus

**Retrieval track complete** — F80, F80.5, F82.c/d/e, F85.a/c/d/f, F86, F87, F88 all landed. Pipeline shape: hybrid retrieval (vector + FTS + SQL metadata + trigram fallback) → weighted RRF → cross-encoder rerank → hydration → highlights. See `docs/rag-pipeline.md` for the current diagram.

Eval on 7-doc fixture: **P@5 0.252 · R@5 1.000 · MRR 0.859**. Ceiling hit on fixture size; further retrieval wins need corpus growth (more docs with overlapping vocabulary).

**Next track: Q&A.** Three features, all user-facing:

- **F81 — RAG answer quality** (backend-driven visible changes: streaming, tighter answers, confidence, citations, graceful failure). Sub-slices F81.a–j laid out below.
- **F92 — Search & RAG UX** (frontend chat polish: streaming UX, inline citations, regenerate, feedback, follow-ups, keyboard shortcuts, error states). Sub-slices F92.2–11 laid out below.
- **F96 — Persistent conversations** (ChatGPT-style): DB-backed chat history, sidebar, URL-per-conversation, survives reload. Foundational — F81.f / F92.9 sit on top of it.

They compose. Good first slice: **F96.a–e** (DB + API + streaming endpoint + URL routing) unlocks F81.a and F92.2 naturally. Alternative first slice: F81.a + F92.2 (streaming) if you'd rather ship perceived-latency wins before persistence.

  - OAuth 2.0 initiation + callback endpoints
  - Store refresh token encrypted per user
  - Settings page: connect/disconnect Gmail

- [x] **F51 · Resume sync worker**

  - Dedup by message-id + attachment hash
  - Ingest attachments through the existing document pipeline

- [ ] **F52 · Follow-up email sending**
  SRS: §Resume Screening · Depends on: F50
  - Template-based follow-ups from candidate detail view
  - Send via Gmail API; log in activity trail

---

## Phase 6 — Observability & Admin (FR19, FR20, UC-10, UC-11)

- [x] **F60 · Activity log / audit trail**

  - `ActivityLog` table (actor, action, resource, at, ip)
  - Middleware captures auth + document + job + email events
  - `GET /logs` with filters; `logs.tsx` wired

- [x] **F61 · Settings & profile**

---

## Phase 7 — Hardening & Deploy

- [x] **F70 · Error handling & API error shape**
  Depends on: F10
  - Consistent error envelope; frontend toast integration; Sentry hook (optional)

- [x] **F71 · Tests**
  Depends on: F10+
  - pytest: auth, documents, search, ranking
  - Playwright: login → upload → search happy path

- [x] **F72 · Dockerfile + production compose**
  Depends on: F00
  - Backend + frontend Dockerfiles; reverse proxy (Caddy/Nginx); HTTPS
  - Separate `docker-compose.prod.yml`

- [x] **F73 · Encryption at rest for sensitive fields**
  SRS: §Privacy and Security · Depends on: F50
  - OAuth refresh tokens + any PII columns encrypted (app-level or pgcrypto)

---

## Phase 8 — Intelligence Enhancement

Improve accuracy, relevance, and usefulness of core AI features.

- [x] **F80 · Search relevance tuning**
  - Minimum similarity threshold — discard vector hits above cosine distance threshold (default 0.6) instead of returning everything
  - SQL metadata path only contributes when structured filters are present (no more "recent documents for any query")
  - Drop max-score normalization lie; expose a confidence band (`high`/`medium`/`low`) instead
  - Dedup + cap highlights per document (max 3 per doc)
  - Eval harness: 15-20 curated queries against fixture docs, precision@5 + MRR baseline via `make eval`
  - Deferred to F80.5 (below): query expansion, RRF recency boost, faceted results

- [x] **F80.5 · Cross-encoder reranker** — `Reranker` protocol + `CrossEncoderReranker` (BAAI/bge-reranker-base, local sentence-transformers) + `NullReranker` + registry. Wired into `SearchService` with `reranker_top_k=20`. Default `reranker_provider=local` after F85.c weighted RRF lands — the candidate set is filename-biased before reranking, so the reranker reshuffles within an already-correct window. Eval: MRR held at 0.859 with the combined stack.
  - Rerank top-20 vector candidates with a local cross-encoder (e.g. `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`)
  - Toggle via `SEARCH_RERANKER_ENABLED` env var for A/B
  - Eval harness measures precision@5 before/after to justify the `sentence-transformers` dep weight

- [ ] **F81 · RAG answer quality** — all user-facing (changes how the answer looks, feels, or what it knows). Proposed sub-slices:
  - [ ] **F81.a** Streaming answers via SSE — replace the synchronous blob with token-by-token output. **User sees:** text appearing as it generates instead of a spinner. Claude SDK already supports streaming; wire through `RagService` + a new `/rag/stream` endpoint.
  - [ ] **F81.b** Context relevance filtering: drop chunks below a vector-distance cutoff before stuffing the prompt. **User sees:** tighter, less rambly answers; fewer "the document mentions X but…" filler sentences.
  - [ ] **F81.c** Token budget management: rank chunks by reranker score (F80.5 already computes), include high-score chunks first, stop at a configurable token budget. **User sees:** RAG works on queries where we'd previously hit context-window errors.
  - [ ] **F81.d** System prompt tuning: be concise, cite filenames inline, say "I don't know" instead of guessing. **User sees:** fewer hallucinated facts, more "not in the provided documents" when warranted.
  - [ ] **F81.e** Answer confidence indicator: `confidence` field on `RagResponse` (high/medium/low) driven by top-chunk distance + heuristics. **User sees:** a coloured badge next to the answer — trust at a glance.
  - [ ] **F81.f** Conversation memory: track the last N message pairs per session in Redis, inject into the prompt. **User sees:** follow-ups like "what about the other resume?" and "show me more like that" work naturally.
  - [ ] **F81.g** Structured answer templates: count queries → number + list; comparison queries → markdown table; skill queries → bullet points. Driven by lightweight intent classification. **User sees:** answers that look right for the question asked — not prose where a table was obvious.
  - [ ] **F81.h** Source citation linking: citations click through to the source doc at the relevant section. Needs `section_heading` metadata (F82.e already stamps it) + a doc-preview route. **User sees:** click `[1]` → doc opens at the right section.
  - [ ] **F81.i** Graceful failure UX: LLM timeout / rate limit / empty retrieval → clear message ("I couldn't find information about X. Try rephrasing or uploading more documents.") instead of silence or raw 500s. **User sees:** the system always says *something* useful.
  - [ ] **F81.j** Inline citation markers: render `[1]`, `[2]` clickable inline in the answer prose (not just a separate list at the bottom). Hover-preview shows source filename + snippet. Makes citations readable mid-sentence instead of foot-note style. **User sees:** "Jane Doe[1] has Kubernetes experience[2]" with hoverable refs.

- [~] **F82 · Chunking strategy improvements** — mixed-doc corpus, not just resumes
  - [ ] **F82.a** (skipped — went straight to F82.d layout-aware extraction instead)
  - [ ] **F82.b** Whole-document chunk: one extra vector per doc with `chunk_kind="document"` holding a concatenated extract (first paragraph + headings + skills list). Helps broad "find me a [persona]" queries that need doc-level signal rather than any single chunk.
  - [x] **F82.d** Layout-aware extraction via `unstructured.partition` (hi_res strategy, GPU-accelerated via local RTX 5050). Persists typed elements (`Title`, `NarrativeText`, `ListItem`, `Table`, …) to `document_elements` + version columns on `documents` (`extraction_version`, `chunking_version`, `embedding_model_version`).
  - [x] **F82.e** Element-aware chunker: headings attached as `section_heading` metadata (not emitted as standalone chunks after F82.c follow-up), tables→own chunk (markdown preferred), lists→intact, narrative→packed ~1200 chars. `CHUNKING_VERSION=v3`.
  - [x] **F82.c** Contextual retrieval (Anthropic): `ChunkContextualizer` protocol backed by any `LlmProvider`; three modes (summary / full_doc / auto). Chunker no longer emits heading-only chunks (CHUNKING_VERSION v3) — heading text lives on subsequent narratives as `section_heading` metadata, saving ~40% of LLM calls per doc. Live wins visible: `menu analyzer` now ranks Menu Analyzer Portfolio at #1 (was #2 under Restaurant Signup). Eval held at P@5 0.252 / R@5 1.000 / MRR 0.859 — fixture corpus too small to show Anthropic's published -35%.
  - [ ] **F82.f** (later) Multi-granularity chunks: sentence + paragraph + section levels with parent-child retrieval. Enables retrieve-small-return-big.
  - Re-index required on any chunk strategy change — `scripts/reindex_embeddings.py` handles it.

- [ ] **F83 · Candidate matching accuracy**
  - Skill normalization: "JS" = "JavaScript", "k8s" = "Kubernetes", "ML" = "Machine Learning"
  - Weighted skill matching: required skills matter more than preferred, exact match > partial
  - Experience range scoring refinement: penalize overqualified less than underqualified
  - Education level hierarchy: PhD > Master's > Bachelor's > Associate's > Diploma
  - Location matching: remote preference, city proximity
  - Match explanation: human-readable sentence explaining why a score is high/low

- [ ] **F84 · Document classification accuracy**
  - Training data: curated examples per document type for the rule-based classifier
  - Confidence calibration: rule-based confidence should reflect actual accuracy
  - Multi-label support: a document can be both "resume" and "letter" (cover letter + CV combo)
  - Classification audit: log classified vs actual type, track accuracy over time
  - User correction: let HR override the classified type, feed back into the system

- [~] **F85 · Embedding quality** (F85.b/e still open — gated on real-corpus scale)
  - [x] **F85.a** Model-agnostic `EmbeddingProvider` protocol + `SentenceTransformerEmbedder` POC with `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`. ChromaVectorStore takes pre-computed vectors; per-model collection naming; `scripts/reindex_embeddings.py`. Eval: P@5 0.253→0.252 (tied), R@5 0.974→**1.000**, MRR 0.870→0.841.
  - [ ] **F85.b** Model exploration — the single biggest unexplored retrieval lever. bge-small-en-v1.5 is a reasonable default but MTEB shows meaningful lift is available on small/base models that still fit on CPU. Candidates to A/B in rough priority order:
    - `intfloat/e5-base-v2` / `intfloat/e5-small-v2` — task-instructed, unlocks F85.e prefixes
    - `BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5` — same family, bigger; usually +2–4 P@5 on MTEB retrieval
    - `nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5` — long-context (8k), matryoshka dims; good for resumes that blow past 512 tokens
    - `jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-base-en` — 8k context, competitive on MTEB
    - `mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1` — top of MTEB small/base tier; slower but may be worth it
    - `thenlper/gte-base` / `gte-large` — Alibaba; strong asymmetric-query scores
    Reference: https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard (filter by "Retrieval (en)"). Recipe per candidate: (1) flip `EMBEDDING_MODEL` in `.env`; (2) `uv run python -m scripts.reindex_embeddings`; (3) `make eval`; (4) compare P@5 / R@5 / MRR against baseline. F85.d means `search_max_distance` auto-travels via the embedder table — add a row to `_MODEL_DISTANCE_THRESHOLDS` before evaluating so hits aren't wrongly filtered. Expected dev-corpus ceiling: current corpus is tiny (8 docs), so wins here will be modest; model exploration matters more once the real corpus grows.
  - [x] **F85.c** Weighted RRF: `_rrf_merge` takes `w_vector` / `w_sql` / `w_lexical` multipliers. Defaults bias lexical up (2.0) so F87's filename-A / skills-B weighting carries through to the merged ranking. Unlocked F80.5 reranker default-on (composes cleanly; MRR holds at 0.859).
  - [x] **F85.d** Per-model distance threshold travels with the embedder. `EmbeddingProvider` protocol now exposes `recommended_distance_threshold`; `SentenceTransformerEmbedder` ships a curated `_MODEL_DISTANCE_THRESHOLDS` table (BGE 0.35, MiniLM/mpnet 0.60, E5 0.50, nomic 0.45, jina 0.40) with a 0.5 default + one-time warning for unknown models. `settings.search_max_distance` is now `float | None` — None means "ask the embedder," an explicit float still overrides (operator knob). `SearchService._resolve_distance_threshold` reads via `ChromaVectorStore.embedder` property. Unlocks model swaps without silent relevance regressions.
  - [ ] **F85.e** Document-type-specific embedding prefixes: "resume: ..." vs "job description: ..." for models that support task instructions (e5, instructor, nomic). **Depends on F85.b** — no point before we adopt an instruct model.
  - [x] Hybrid retrieval: Postgres FTS (`ts_rank_cd`) folded into RRF — eval P@5 0.175→0.238 (+36%), `edge` bucket 0.0→0.4
  - [x] **F85.f** Embedding versioning + startup integrity log. Per-chunk `embedding_model_version` stamped at index time ✅. `ChromaVectorStore._log_startup_integrity` logs `collection=<name> model=<name> chunks=<N>` on construction and warns when the Chroma collection's `embedding_model` metadata drifts from the configured embedder (pointing operators to `scripts/reindex_embeddings.py`). Non-fatal — wrapped in try/except so diagnostics can't crash boot.

- [x] **F86 · Search correctness (P0)** — see `docs/search-hardening.md` §3
  - [x] Per-user ownership scoping (admin bypass) wired into vector `where`, FTS, and SQL metadata paths
  - [x] Status filter on vector path: non-READY docs with stale chunks no longer surface
  - [x] **F86.c** Drop orphan vector hits (Chroma chunks for deleted Postgres docs) before RRF — was poisoning ranking by giving high vector scores to nonexistent docs and pushing real lexical hits out of top-K
  - Tenancy decision: per-user with admin bypass, matches `DocumentService._ensure_access`

- [x] **F87 · Multi-field weighted FTS (P1)** — see `docs/search-hardening.md` §4
  - [x] Replaced `extracted_text_tsv` with weighted `search_tsv`: filename (A, regexp-tokenized for `_-./` separators), `metadata.skills` (B), `extracted_text` (C)
  - [x] `document_type` deliberately not indexed — `enum::text` is non-IMMUTABLE in Postgres; structured filter handles those 5 values better
  - [x] No `SearchService` changes; `ts_rank_cd` does the weighting automatically
  - Eval lift on top of F86: **P@5 0.238→0.253, R@5 0.906→0.974, MRR 0.781→0.868 (+11%)**; new `filename` bucket MRR=1.0; live `menu analyzer` query now ranks Menu Analyzer Portfolio Doc.pdf at #1

- [x] **F88 · Query syntax & understanding (P1 + P2)** — see `docs/search-hardening.md` §3
  - [x] **F88.a** Switch `plainto_tsquery` → `websearch_to_tsquery` (phrase/OR/NOT), empty/whitespace short-circuit at service edge, query length cap (1024 chars) — same eval baseline (additive syntax)
  - [x] **F88.b** Canonical acronym expansion (one-directional: `k8s → kubernetes`, `ml → machine learning`, `js → javascript`, ~25 entries; ambiguous like `cv`/`tf` omitted). Applied to FTS only; vector handles equivalence semantically.
  - [x] **F88.c** Typo tolerance: `pg_trgm` `word_similarity` fallback over filename **and body** (`GREATEST` of both) when FTS returns 0; threshold 0.25. Body fallback was added after a real user-reported case (`pyhton` returned 0 because no filename had `python`).
  - [x] **F88.d** Special-token preservation (`C++`/`C#`/`F#`/`.NET`/`Node.js`/`Objective-C`): mirrored substitution at index time (Postgres `normalize_tech_tokens` SQL function) and query time (Python helper)
  - Known limitations: negation (`-term`) only constrains the FTS path; vector RRF can still surface negated docs. Highlight tokenizer (F92.1) doesn't see normalized tokens — non-issue today since query/snippet share the raw input, but worth flagging if highlighting ever consumes the normalized form.

- [ ] **F89 · Search polish (P2 + P3)** — see `docs/search-hardening.md` §3
  - Recency tie-breaking: stable `created_at desc` when RRF scores tie
  - Pagination: add `offset` to `SearchRequest`
  - Mixed-language fallback: try `simple` analyzer when `english` produces empty tsvector
  - Skill normalization (coordinate with F83): canonical form for `python`/`Python`/`py3`
  - Experience parsing: prose → numeric range (`5+ years`, `senior`)

## Phase 9 — UI/UX Polish

Production-grade interface with attention to detail, accessibility, and delight.

- [ ] **F90 · Design system audit**
  - Consistent spacing, typography scale, color usage across all pages
  - Dark mode: verify every component, fix contrast issues
  - Responsive: test and fix all pages at mobile, tablet, desktop breakpoints
  - Loading skeletons on every page (replace spinners with content-shaped placeholders)
  - Transition animations: page transitions, list item enter/exit, modal open/close

- [ ] **F91 · Documents page polish**
  - Drag-and-drop upload zone on the main page (not just in dialog)
  - Upload progress with real percentage (streaming upload)
  - Document processing status: live polling or WebSocket for pending → ready transition
  - Inline preview for PDFs (embedded viewer)
  - Bulk actions: select multiple → delete, export, create candidates

- [~] **F92 · Search & RAG UX** — frontend polish. Backend answer-quality lives in F81.
  - Search page:
    - Search-as-you-type with debounce
    - Filter pills: visual chips for active filters, one-click remove
    - [x] **F92.1** Search result highlighting: offset-based `match_spans` on `/search` and `/rag/query`; frontend `<HighlightedText>` renders `<mark>`
    - Suggested queries: show example queries when the search box is empty
    - Recent queries dropdown under the search input
    - Empty-state with illustrations + "try these" prompts
  - RAG chat:
    - [ ] **F92.2** Streaming chat UX: typing indicator, cursor animation while tokens arrive, stop-generation button, auto-scroll lock when the user is reading. Pairs with F81.a backend.
    - [ ] **F92.3** Inline clickable citation markers in the answer (pairs with F81.j). Hover tooltip shows source filename + context; click opens the source (pairs with F81.h).
    - [ ] **F92.4** Copy answer button (markdown) and copy-as-plaintext. Per-message copy + full-conversation export (markdown file).
    - [ ] **F92.5** Regenerate button on each assistant message — retry with same query, optionally with "give me a shorter answer" / "be more technical" variants.
    - [ ] **F92.6** Thumbs-up / thumbs-down on each answer, persisted to a feedback table. Optional free-text reason on thumbs-down. Drives future prompt-tuning.
    - [ ] **F92.7** Suggested follow-up questions beneath each assistant message — generated by the LLM in the same turn as the answer (cheap piggyback call). Drives discovery.
    - [ ] **F92.8** Doc-scope selector: "Ask about: [all documents / this one / selected…]". Limits retrieval to chosen IDs via the existing `document_ids` param on `/rag/query`.
    - [ ] **F92.9** Conversation management: new-chat button, sidebar list of past conversations, rename, delete, search across conversations. Backs F81.f conversation memory.
    - [ ] **F92.10** Keyboard shortcuts: ⌘+Enter to send (already works), ⌘+N new chat, ⌘+K focus search, Escape to stop generation, ↑ to edit last message.
    - [ ] **F92.11** Error / empty-state UX: network down, LLM rate-limited, no retrieval hits — clear messaging + "retry" affordance. Pairs with F81.i backend.

- [ ] **F93 · Jobs & candidates UX**
  - Job detail page with description, requirements, and matched candidates list
  - Candidate profile page: resume viewer + extracted info + application history
  - Kanban board view for applications (drag between new/shortlisted/rejected/hired)
  - Match score visualization: radar chart or bar breakdown (skills/experience/vector)
  - One-click "create candidates from all resumes" batch action
  - CSV export button directly on the candidates table

- [ ] **F94 · Dashboard & navigation**
  - Activity feed: recent actions as a timeline (not just table)
  - Quick actions: upload, create job, search from dashboard
  - Keyboard shortcuts: ⌘K for search, ⌘U for upload
  - Breadcrumbs on nested pages (job detail, candidate profile)
  - Empty states with illustrations, not just icons
  - Toast notifications: success/error/info with consistent styling

- [ ] **F95 · Accessibility & performance**
  - ARIA labels on all interactive elements
  - Keyboard navigation: tab order, focus rings, escape to close modals
  - Screen reader testing on core flows (login, upload, search)
  - Lighthouse audit: target 90+ on performance, accessibility, best practices
  - Bundle analysis: lazy-load heavy pages (search, RAG chat)
  - Image optimization: proper formats, lazy loading

- [ ] **F96 · Persistent conversations (ChatGPT-style)** — replaces today's
  in-memory chat state in `SearchPage` with proper multi-conversation chat:
  sidebar, history, URL-per-conversation, survives page reload. Compose
  with F81.f (prompt-injected memory) and F92.9 (UI sidebar) — F96 is the
  persistence layer both sit on.

  Backend:
  - [ ] **F96.a** Schema: `conversations` (id, owner_id, title, created_at,
    updated_at, archived, metadata jsonb) + `chat_messages` (id,
    conversation_id, role, content, citations jsonb, model, tokens,
    created_at). Alembic migration + cascade on owner delete.
  - [ ] **F96.b** REST API: `POST/GET/PATCH/DELETE /conversations`,
    `POST /conversations/{id}/messages` (replaces direct `/rag/query`),
    `GET /conversations/{id}/messages`. Owner-scoped per F86.
  - [ ] **F96.c** Auto-title: after the first exchange, cheap Haiku call
    summarizes the question into a 3-6 word title. Stored on the
    conversation row; user-editable.
  - [ ] **F96.d** Streaming on `POST /conversations/{id}/messages` via SSE —
    composes with F81.a. Persist the completed assistant message only on
    stream close; show-but-don't-save during generation.

  Frontend:
  - [ ] **F96.e** Route per conversation: `/chat/:id`. New-chat creates
    lazily on first message. Direct URL load hydrates from API.
  - [ ] **F96.f** Sidebar (replaces the placeholder in F92.9): list
    conversations grouped by recency (Today / Yesterday / Past week /
    Older), rename-inline, archive/delete, search across titles + message
    content.
  - [ ] **F96.g** Migration path: the current `SearchPage` chat state moves
    into a dedicated `ChatPage`; the Search tab stays as search-only; the
    Q&A tab links into the new chat route on first message.

  Decisions worth pinning before starting:
  - Shared vs private conversations — default private per-user; shareable
    links as a later F96.h if needed.
  - Delete = soft (`archived=true`) or hard (remove row + cascade
    messages)? Default soft for recoverability.
  - Retention policy — auto-archive conversations with no activity in N
    days? Default: no auto-archive until we have data to tune on.

## Out of scope for v1
- ERP integrations, video tutorials, print-friendly quick-start, mobile apps
- GPU-optimized local LLM deployment (provider abstraction covers it later)
- Gmail integration (Phase 5 — deferred, needs Google OAuth setup)
