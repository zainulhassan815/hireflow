  - Drive CORS origins from env (`ALLOWED_ORIGINS`)
  - Real `.env.example` for Postgres, Redis, Chroma, JWT, Gmail OAuth, LLM provider
  - `backend/app/core/config.py` split: settings validated at import

  SRS: infra · Depends on: F00
  - Async SQLAlchemy 2.x engine + session dependency
  - Alembic initialized with autogenerate
  - Base `User` model (id, email, hashed_password, role, timestamps)

---

## Phase 1 — Authentication (FR01–FR03, UC-01, UC-02)

- [x] **F10 · Backend auth: register + login + JWT**
  SRS: FR01, FR03 · Depends on: F01
  - `POST /auth/register`, `POST /auth/login` return access + refresh tokens
  - Bcrypt/argon2 password hashing
  - `get_current_user` dependency; protect all non-public routes

  Not user-facing. Moves auth/session/reset code behind `Protocol`s, adds
  `domain/exceptions.py` + an error-handler, introduces `repositories/`,
  formalises `Authorizer`. Routes become minimal HTTP wrappers. All F10–F14
  HTTP contracts preserved and re-exercised.

## Phase 4 — Jobs & Candidates (FR11–FR16, UC-06, UC-07, UC-12)

- [x] **F40 · Jobs CRUD**
  SRS: FR11, FR12 · Depends on: F14
  - `Job` model (title, description, required_skills[], experience_min, education, status)
  - `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /jobs`
  - Frontend `jobs` pages wired

  - Dedup by message-id + attachment hash
  - Ingest attachments through the existing document pipeline

- [ ] **F52 · Follow-up email sending**

---

## Phase 8 — Intelligence Enhancement

Improve accuracy, relevance, and usefulness of core AI features.

- [x] **F80 · Search relevance tuning**
  - Minimum similarity threshold — discard vector hits above cosine distance threshold (default 0.6) instead of returning everything
  - SQL metadata path only contributes when structured filters are present (no more "recent documents for any query")
  - Drop max-score normalization lie; expose a confidence band (`high`/`medium`/`low`) instead
  - Dedup + cap highlights per document (max 3 per doc)
  - Eval harness: 15-20 curated queries against fixture docs, precision@5 + MRR baseline via `make eval`
  - Deferred to F80.5 (below): query expansion, RRF recency boost, faceted results

- [ ] **F80.5 · Cross-encoder reranker**
  - Rerank top-20 vector candidates with a local cross-encoder (e.g. `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`)
  - Toggle via `SEARCH_RERANKER_ENABLED` env var for A/B
  - Eval harness measures precision@5 before/after to justify the `sentence-transformers` dep weight

- [ ] **F81 · RAG answer quality**
  - Structured answer templates: count queries → return number + list, comparison queries → table format, skill queries → bullet points
  - Context relevance filtering — drop chunks that are below similarity threshold before sending to LLM (reduces noise)
  - System prompt tuning: be concise, format matters, answer the specific question asked
  - Token budget management: prioritize high-relevance chunks, truncate low-relevance ones
  - Answer confidence indicator: if context is thin, say so explicitly and suggest uploading more documents
  - Support follow-up context (conversation memory within a session)

- [ ] **F82 · Chunking strategy improvements**
  - Semantic chunking: split on topic boundaries, not character count
  - Overlap tuning per document type (resumes need different chunking than reports)
  - Metadata-enriched chunks: each chunk carries its section header (Skills, Experience, Education) for better retrieval
  - Re-index existing documents when chunking strategy changes

- [ ] **F83 · Candidate matching accuracy**
  - Skill normalization: "JS" = "JavaScript", "k8s" = "Kubernetes", "ML" = "Machine Learning"
  - Weighted skill matching: required skills matter more than preferred, exact match > partial
  - Experience range scoring refinement: penalize overqualified less than underqualified
  - Education level hierarchy: PhD > Master's > Bachelor's > Associate's > Diploma
  - Location matching: remote preference, city proximity
  - Match explanation: human-readable sentence explaining why a score is high/low

- [ ] **F84 · Document classification accuracy**
  - Training data: curated examples per document type for the rule-based classifier
  - Confidence calibration: rule-based confidence should reflect actual accuracy
  - Multi-label support: a document can be both "resume" and "letter" (cover letter + CV combo)
  - Classification audit: log classified vs actual type, track accuracy over time
  - User correction: let HR override the classified type, feed back into the system

- [~] **F85 · Embedding quality**
  - Evaluate embedding model options: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 vs all-mpnet-base-v2 vs instructor-xl
  - Document-type-specific embedding prefixes: "resume: ..." vs "job description: ..."
  - [x] Hybrid retrieval: Postgres FTS (`ts_rank_cd`) folded into RRF — eval P@5 0.175→0.238 (+36%), `edge` bucket 0.0→0.4
  - Embedding versioning: track which model generated each chunk's embedding, re-index on model change

- [x] **F86 · Search correctness (P0)** — see `docs/search-hardening.md` §3
  - [x] Per-user ownership scoping (admin bypass) wired into vector `where`, FTS, and SQL metadata paths
  - [x] Status filter on vector path: non-READY docs with stale chunks no longer surface
  - Tenancy decision: per-user with admin bypass, matches `DocumentService._ensure_access`
  - Eval baseline unchanged (P@5 = 0.238); 7 new tests covering scoping + status

- [x] **F87 · Multi-field weighted FTS (P1)** — see `docs/search-hardening.md` §4
  - [x] Replaced `extracted_text_tsv` with weighted `search_tsv`: filename (A, regexp-tokenized for `_-./` separators), `metadata.skills` (B), `extracted_text` (C)
  - [x] `document_type` deliberately not indexed — `enum::text` is non-IMMUTABLE in Postgres; structured filter handles those 5 values better
  - [x] No `SearchService` changes; `ts_rank_cd` does the weighting automatically
  - Eval lift on top of F86: **P@5 0.238→0.253, R@5 0.906→0.974, MRR 0.781→0.868 (+11%)**; new `filename` bucket MRR=1.0; live `menu analyzer` query now ranks Menu Analyzer Portfolio Doc.pdf at #1

- [~] **F88 · Query syntax & understanding (P1 + P2)** — see `docs/search-hardening.md` §3
  - [x] **F88.a** Switch `plainto_tsquery` → `websearch_to_tsquery` (phrase/OR/NOT), empty/whitespace short-circuit at service edge, query length cap (1024 chars) — same eval baseline (additive syntax)
  - [x] **F88.b** Canonical acronym expansion (one-directional: `k8s → kubernetes`, `ml → machine learning`, `js → javascript`, ~25 entries; ambiguous like `cv`/`tf` omitted). Applied to FTS only; vector handles equivalence semantically.
  - [ ] **F88.c** Typo tolerance: `pg_trgm` similarity fallback when `ts_rank_cd` returns empty
  - [ ] **F88.d** Special-token preservation (`C++`, `.NET`, `Node.js`, `C#`) on both index and query side; share helper with F92.1 highlight tokenizer
  - Known limitation: negation (`-term`) only constrains the FTS path; vector RRF can still surface negated docs. Cross-source semantics fix is its own slice if needed.

- [ ] **F89 · Search polish (P2 + P3)** — see `docs/search-hardening.md` §3
  - Recency tie-breaking: stable `created_at desc` when RRF scores tie
  - Pagination: add `offset` to `SearchRequest`
  - Mixed-language fallback: try `simple` analyzer when `english` produces empty tsvector
  - Skill normalization (coordinate with F83): canonical form for `python`/`Python`/`py3`
  - Experience parsing: prose → numeric range (`5+ years`, `senior`)

- [~] **F92 · Search & RAG UX**
  - Search-as-you-type with debounce
  - Filter pills: visual chips for active filters, one-click remove

  - Suggested queries: show example queries when search is empty

- [ ] **F93 · Jobs & candidates UX**

  - Candidate profile page: resume viewer + extracted info + application history
  - Kanban board view for applications (drag between new/shortlisted/rejected/hired)
  - Match score visualization: radar chart or bar breakdown (skills/experience/vector)
  - One-click "create candidates from all resumes" batch action
  - CSV export button directly on the candidates table

- [ ] **F94 · Dashboard & navigation**
  - Activity feed: recent actions as a timeline (not just table)
  - Quick actions: upload, create job, search from dashboard
  - Keyboard shortcuts: ⌘K for search, ⌘U for upload
  - Breadcrumbs on nested pages (job detail, candidate profile)
  - Empty states with illustrations, not just icons
  - Toast notifications: success/error/info with consistent styling

- [ ] **F95 · Accessibility & performance**

  - Keyboard navigation: tab order, focus rings, escape to close modals
  - Screen reader testing on core flows (login, upload, search)
  - Lighthouse audit: target 90+ on performance, accessibility, best practices
  - Bundle analysis: lazy-load heavy pages (search, RAG chat)
  - Image optimization: proper formats, lazy loading
