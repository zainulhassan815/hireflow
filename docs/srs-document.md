# Introduction

## Purpose

The project is intended to help organizations in effectively managing, searching, and extracting meaningful information from large and unstructured collection of documents. Manual document scrutiny and resume screening processes are time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient. The proposed project addresses these challenges by using AI driven tools that enhance document understanding and information retrieval.

## Project Scope

The problem that most businesses face when trying to manage and gain insight from large collections of documents is addressed by the AI-Powered HR Screening and Document Retrieval System Using RAG. The time-consuming manual review of documents is eliminated by the system, which also provides a capable system for document comprehension and analysis.

### Key Capabilities

**Document Processing**

The system processes these file types:

- PDF files
- Microsoft Word documents
- Scanned images
- Classifies documents by type

**Natural Language Interface**

- Search documents using plain English queries
- Ask questions about document content
- Tags them with relevant metadata

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**

- Finds relevant document content based on the user's query
- Uses semantic search
- Gives the factual context from stored documents

### Document Screening

- Helps HR Team in document screening of collected attachments from incoming emails
- Handles multiple resume formats
- Matches and ranks candidates against job specific requirements

### External Interfaces

The system connects to HR Team email accounts for document collection. Email integration uses OAuth authentication without storing credentials. Future versions may include connections to ERP systems and document management platforms.

### Hardware Platform

The system runs on standard server hardware or cloud instances. Users access it through web browsers without needing to install any software.

## Product Features

The system includes the following features:

### Document Processing and Management

Users can upload PDF, Word documents, and scanned images using drag-and-drop or batch uploads. The system then:

- Extracts text using OCR
- Classifies documents by type (resumes, reports, contracts, letters)
- Generates metadata (document type, date, author, and other attributes)
- Stores everything in a searchable format

A dashboard lets users view, sort, filter, preview, download, and delete documents.

### Search and Retrieval

Users can search using natural language queries instead of exact keywords. The system uses vector embeddings to find documents based on meaning, not just matching words. Users can filter results by document type, date range, or other metadata. Results are ranked by relevance and show matching text with highlights.

### RAG System

Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methodology, the system answers questions about uploaded documents. Users ask questions in plain language through a chat interface. The system finds relevant content and generates responses based on that content.

**Example queries:**

- "Extract skills from candidate John's resume"
- "Summarize the findings in the Q3 report"
- "What are the key terms in this contract?"

### Resume Screening

HR personnel create job descriptions with required skills, education, experience, and other criteria. The HR module connects to Gmail accounts using OAuth authentication and collects resume attachments from incoming emails. It keeps a history of collected resumes and lets HR personnel send follow-up emails to candidates.

### Privacy and Security

The system includes role-based access control, authentication, activity logging, and audit trails to help protect data and support privacy compliance.

## User Classes and Characteristics

### HR Personnel

HR personnel use the system mainly for resume screening and candidate management. They have moderate technical skills and are familiar with recruitment workflows. They need features for:

- Connecting email accounts
- Defining job descriptions
- Reviewing candidate information
- Managing shortlists
- Exporting candidate data
- Communicating with applicants

HR personnel use the system frequently during recruitment cycles and occasionally at other times. The system should reduce the time spent on manual resume review.

### Email Service

The Email Service is an external system that handles email-based tasks in the HR module. It connects to email accounts using OAuth 2.0 to access and collect incoming resume attachments. It runs in the background and performs predefined tasks, helping to sync resumes and reduce manual effort for HR personnel.

## Operating Environment

- Future integrations may include document management systems, ERP platforms, or other applications via REST APIs

## Design and Implementation Constraints

### Privacy and Security Constraints

- The system should implement security measures to protect sensitive information
- Data encryption should be applied at rest and in transit
- Audit trails should be maintained for data access and processing activities
- Role-based access control (RBAC) should restrict functionality based on user privileges
